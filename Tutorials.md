## Description 

In recent years, Neural Language Generation (NLG) techniques including large language models (LLMs) have greatly advanced, especially in the realm of open-ended text generation. With respect to the quality of generated texts, therefore, it is no longer trivial to tell the difference between human-written and NLG-generated texts (so-called ‚Äúdeepfake texts‚Äù). While this is a celebratory feat for NLG, however, it poses new security risks (e.g., generation of misinformation or phishing messages at scale). To combat this novel challenge, researchers have developed diverse techniques to automatically detect NLG-generated texts. While this niche field of deepfake text detection is growing, the field of NLG is growing at a much faster rate, thus making it difficult to understand the complex interplay between state-of-the-art NLG methods and the detectability of their deepfake texts. Scaling up the problem further to the case of ùëò NLG methods (ùëò ‚â• 2), each generating uniquely-different yet human-quality texts, two new computational problems emerge: (1) ‚ÄúNeural" Authorship Attribution (AA) and (2) ‚ÄúNeural" Authorship Obfuscation (AO) problems, where the AA problem is concerned with attributing the authorship of a given text to one of ùëò NLG methods, while the AO problem is to evade the authorship of a given text by modifying parts of the text. Both problems lie in the security field, and their importance and implications are growing rapidly. In this training, therefore, we call-attention to the serious security risks both emerging problems pose and give a comprehensive tutorial of recent literature on the detection and obfuscation of deepfake text authorships.  Hands-on examples/quizzes of the generation, detection, and obfuscation of deepfake texts for engaging with participation interactively. We invite an audience from all sub-fields of cybersecurity to attend this very timely workshop.
