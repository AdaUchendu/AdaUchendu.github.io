I graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a B.S in Mathematics and a minor 
in Statistics in May 2018. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Sciences and Technology at the
Pennsylvania State University under the guidance of my Research Advisor, [Dr. Dongwon Lee](http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/), an Associate 
professor at the University. My research interests are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and 
Data mining in the application domain of Cybersecurity. 

Specifically, I am interested in research that leverages data mining and machine learning techniques to 
solve issues that have security implications. Currently, I am working on a project that uses NLP (Natural 
Language Processing) techniques to distinguish machine-generated texts from human-generated texts. My ultimate goal is to find subtle linguistic patterns that differentiate human-generated texts from 
machine-generated in order to better detect these text-generators. 

Also, for fun you can view this [page](https://news.umbc.edu/adaku-uchendu-to-extend-passion-for-mathematics-through-information-sciences-ph-d-at-penn-state/) that talks about me.
