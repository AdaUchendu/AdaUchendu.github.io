I am an AI Researcher at MIT Lincoln Lab. I earned my Ph.D. in [Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at The Pennsylvania State University under the guidance of [Dr. Dongwon Lee](http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/) at the [PIKE Lab](http://pike.psu.edu/) in August 2023. While at Penn State, I was a Button-Waller Fellow, an NSF Scholarship for Service Scholar, and an Alfred P. Sloan Scholar. I earned a B.S. in Mathematics, with a minor in Statistics at [University of Maryland Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu/) (UMBC) in May 2018. While at UMBC, I was a McNair scholar and a member of Pi Mu Epsilon (the Mathematical Honorary Society). My research interests are: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data mining in the application domain of Cybersecurity. 
Specifically, I am interested in:
* NLP (Natural Language Processing)
* NLG (Natural Language Generation), such as Large Language Models (LLMs) 
* Adversarial Robustness & Adversarial Machine Learning  
* TDA (Topological Data Analysis)
