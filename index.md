I graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a B.S in Mathematics and a minor 
in Statistics in May 2018. I am currently a third year Ph.D. student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology at The](https://ist.psu.edu/)
Pennsylvania State University under the guidance of [Dr. Dongwon Lee](http://pike.psu.edu/dongwon/) at the [PIKE Lab](http://pike.psu.edu/). My research interests are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and 
Data mining in the application domain of Cybersecurity. 
Specifically, I am interested in NLP (Natural Language Processing), NLG (Natural Language Generation), and Adversarial Robustness (both in Computer Vision and Text Classification).


Also, for fun you can view this [page](https://news.umbc.edu/adaku-uchendu-to-extend-passion-for-mathematics-through-information-sciences-ph-d-at-penn-state/) that talks about me.
