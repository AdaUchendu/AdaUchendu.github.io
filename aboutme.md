I graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a B.S in Mathematics and a minor 
in Statistics in May 2018. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Information Sciences and Technology at 
Pennsylvania State University under the guidance of my Research Advisor, Dr. Dongwon Lee, an Associate 
professor at the University. My research interests are data mining, machine learning, and cyber-security. 
Specifically, I am interested in research that leverages data mining and machine learning techniques to 
solve issues that have security implications. Currently, I am working on a project that uses NLP (Natural 
Language Processing) techniques to distinguish chatbot-generated texts from human-generated texts with Dr. Dongwon Lee. 
This requires combining NLP and 
data mining tools with Python packages to build machine learning models to detect Human and Chatbot texts 
from the data. Furthermore, my goal is to find linguistic patterns that prove Human and Machine texts are in 
fact very different. 

Also, for fun you can view this [page](https://news.umbc.edu/adaku-uchendu-to-extend-passion-for-mathematics-through-information-sciences-ph-d-at-penn-state/) that talks about me.
